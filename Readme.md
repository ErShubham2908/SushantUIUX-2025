# UI/UX Development Advanced - Notes 
## HTML - HyperText Markup Language - 31st Jan '25

**HTML :** HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It's the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of tags and attributes.

These tags define the various elements of a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render them into visual web pages for users to view and interact with on the internet.

### What is Tag, Attributes, Elements, and content?
1. **Tag :** Imagine tags like little instruction manuals for the web browser. They come in pairs, a start tag < and an end tag >  with the element name in between. For example, 
< h1> is a start tag for a heading element, and </ h1> is its closing tag.
   - **Ex -** img tag for image, p tag for paragraph, h1 to h6 for heading.

2. **Attributes :** Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always specified in the opening tag of an element. Attributes are made up of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=) and enclosed in double or single quotes. Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element.
   - **Ex :** the href attribute in an < a> tag specifies the URL of the link, and the src attribute in an < img> tag specifies the source (URL) of an image.

3. **Content :** This is the information that goes between the start and end tags of an element. It can be text, images, videos, or even other HTML elements (elements can be nested within each other). The content determines what the user sees or interacts with on the webpage.
   - **Ex :** `<p>This is Paragraph Content</p>`

4. **Elements :** An element is a complete set of tags and their content, including the opening tag, closing tag, and any content nested within them. Together, they define a particular component or piece of content on a webpage.
   - **Ex :**`<p>This is a Paragraph.</p>`

## Tag, Font, Multimedia and List in HTML - 7th Feb '25

### Type of Tag and Elements in HTML
### Type of Tag

1. **Semantic tag** - A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Ex: < img>, < header>, < footer>, < article>, < table>
2. **Non-Semantic Tag** - div, span

1. **Self-Closing Tag**
   - **Definition:** Self-closing tags in HTML do not require a separate closing tag. They self-terminate with a slash at the end of the tag.
   - **Example:** input, br, hr, img, meta
2. **Seperate Closing Tag**
   - **Definition:** Separate closing tags are used for HTML elements that enclose content and require both an opening and a closing tag to define the content's boundaries.
   - **Example:** paragraph tag, ancher tag, heading tag

### Type of Elements
2. **Block level tag** - In HTML, block-level elements are elements that start a new line on a web page and take up the full width of their parent element.
Ex:  < div>, < p>, < h1> to < h6>, and < ul>, etc.
1. **inline tag** -  Inline elements are used within block-level elements to style or format specific parts of the content. They donâ€™t start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
Ex: < span>, < a>, < strong>, and < em>.
